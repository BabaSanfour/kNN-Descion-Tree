This is an impelemtation from scratch for KNN (and weighted kNN) and 
Decision Tree.

The jupyter start with some data analysis on the publicly available 
datasets: hepatitis data and messidor data. That will be used later to run 
some analysis using kNN and DT.

All the metrics (accuracy, f1-score, confusion matrix, tpr, fpr, 
sensitivity, ..) are implemented from scratch too.

In the experiments we find methods for HP selection, feature selection, 
normalizing the data ...

-These Datasets are open source and publicly available online.
